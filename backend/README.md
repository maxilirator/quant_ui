# Quant UI FastAPI Service Skeleton

This directory contains a FastAPI application that mirrors the endpoints defined in
[`ARCHITECTURE_UI.md`](../ARCHITECTURE_UI.md). The implementation ships with static placeholder data so that the
frontend can be developed before the research engine is fully integrated.

## Getting started

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The service exposes the documented routes under the `/api` prefix. Explore the autogenerated documentation at
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## Environment variables

The service honours the following variables (defaults shown):

```text
QUANT_DB_PATH=./runs.sqlite
QUANT_DATA_ROOT=./data_curated
QUANT_RAW_ROOT=./data_raw
QUANT_API_KEY=                       # optional
BROKER_MODE=dummy
```

These defaults align with the roadmap and keep the skeleton ready for persistence integration later on.
