# Quant UI Skeleton

This repository contains the scaffolding for a SvelteKit frontend and FastAPI backend described in
[`ARCHITECTURE_UI.md`](ARCHITECTURE_UI.md). Both applications are wired with placeholder data so that the integration
points can be exercised end-to-end before real quant research pipelines are available.

- `frontend/` – SvelteKit application with routes for the dashboard landing page and `/strategies` view.
- `backend/` – FastAPI service exposing the API surface enumerated in the architecture brief.

Consult the READMEs in each directory for setup instructions.
